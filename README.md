# Image-Classification

## Overview
This project aims to explore and compare various neural network architectures using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes experimentation with both Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), evaluating their performance using different optimizers and contrasting shallow versus deep learning structures through alternate layer configurations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. CIFAR-10 comprises 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, making it suitable for image classification tasks.

## Methodology: Models Explored

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):

* Experimented with three different optimizers: Adam, SGD, and RMSProp.
* Evaluated shallow and deep learning structures by altering the number of layers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

* Employed various architectures, comparing different optimizers.
* Conducted experiments altering CNN depth to examine the impact on performance.

## Results

After thorough experimentation, the CNN architecture emerged as the more effective model compared to ANNs. The CNNs showcased superior performance, achieving higher accuracy scores on the CIFAR-10 dataset, particularly when compared to shallow and deep ANNs.
